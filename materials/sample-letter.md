# Sample Investor Letter — Excerpt (Draft)

Dear Partners,

We invest as long-term business owners. Our focus remains on a small set of exceptional companies with durable competitive advantages and ample reinvestment runways. Activity remains low by design; time in great businesses is the primary driver of compounding.

Portfolio commentary focuses on business progress, not price action. We evaluate management’s capital allocation, moat durability, and unit economics through cycles. When opportunities arise, we size with conviction and patience.

We appreciate your partnership and long-duration mindset.

Sincerely,
Zach Wright
